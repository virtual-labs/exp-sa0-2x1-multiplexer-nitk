        "a": "",
        "b": "Stuck-at fault testing involves applying specific test vectors to detect faults, not relying solely on the actual input and output values at a terminal. The fault is assumed to be permanently stuck at a logic level, and test patterns are designed to reveal discrepancies in circuit behavior."

        "a": " Multiplexers are commonly referred to as data selectors because they select one of several input signals and forward it to a single output line based on select inputs.",
